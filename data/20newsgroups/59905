date planetary missions posting changes material planetary missions venus mars first send spacecraft venus minutes launch ground rocket due problem computer took control however software rocket went course range safety although sometimes actually software normal serious first probe venus information venus now world atmosphere later launched space energy power solar probe soon now solar orbit mars probe mars took first images surface planet probe found world atmosphere much thought many scientists mars world sense sent venus data planet years information pressure surface least times surface sent mars work done years however take away mars planet first made basic rocket probe first orbit mars information planet probe done surface well systems evidence water planet probe also took first images small used venus gravity probe first images atmosphere fact system planet earth days made control probe world mass much thought seem makes planet moon sun venus jupiter moon far enough space provide new information area earth moon including new data allen earth rocket launched moon probe moon first spacecraft orbit sun designed venus mission instead environment venus earth million solar orbit still information time number launch first spacecraft jupiter went become first probe study space first ever venus also known venus orbiter atmosphere made first studies surface via probe venus also known sent small atmosphere spacecraft high atmosphere surface though surface day probe make minutes ground lunar missions test lunar high earth orbit rocket problems left low launched surface moon problems launch caused probe moon solar orbit try take images moon space launched april purpose technical problems lunar first probe moon without data launched similar solar power moon solar orbit lunar missions send back live images lunar surface moon well first lunar lunar images lunar orbiter lunar surface lunar orbiter designed orbit moon various areas missions also lunar surface lunar launched missions first orbit moon lunar surface missions lunar designed see lunar surface moon without time moon great support vehicle lunar surface enough hold spacecraft missions first moon taking images analysis earth last scientific mission mars launched titan rocket probe went orbit set soon still whether found life sent back thing scientists sky thought sky due atmosphere set among field far orbiter keep command sent never may interesting side note station national air space washington station launched orbit orbiter april around planet launched past jupiter launched jupiter took way planet planet sure thing titan close knowledge satellites become jupiter new satellites major jupiter major effects satellites including satellites keep jupiter great white known atmosphere star big thanks engineering mission found already found different satellites found rather including satellites also last evidence possible next major scientific planetary missions since many moon venus mars missions lunar lunar moon first solar orbit first lunar surface took first images lunar took first images lunar since also test future mars missions first probe moon images surface first probe orbit moon second lunar mission first similar missions tests lunar vehicle first probe moon lunar earth similar mission first lunar surface similar last lunar mission date venus first venus mission venus mission probe just images place surface just probe first another planet first probe data atmosphere air pressure surface mission similar first probe data surface another planet mission sent first surface also first probe orbit venus similar mission first images surface similar mission surface first atmosphere including went become first spacecraft study comet mars mars first mars probe following year first possible place surface probe mars first mars probe surface orbiter first probe planet mars first surface mars mars rockets probe went solar orbit mars first mars mission mars images surface probe mars surface mars mars went solar orbit first surface moon probe due moon probe mars orbit early week jupiter even within next years major yet taken studies moon mars venus various mission orbit world many changes now states future space program seen japanese planetary missions launched space center comet within million spacecraft work now made earth orbit similar approach first japanese spacecraft approach years second small lunar probe launched earth orbit spacecraft known orbit probe earth made first satellite point orbit satellite around moon states spacecraft orbit around moon apparently radio caused japanese space scientists rocket rocket using observatory made lunar using atmosphere made close approach moon surface propulsion system minutes put lunar orbit following orbital results approach days planetary mission also reading following works groups general specific particular space missions sources space list means designed give start research available works subject anyone works list though think best started general order give clear idea history space exploration area also good general works astronomy system give found good public university recently published works also good mass market general order new solar system space exploration space technology planetary spacecraft lunar planetary exploration american space program history propulsion laboratory universe mark solar system mars mars flight space far nasa james comet life science planetary exploration years space solar system specific mission mission venus first venus space mission earth earth information case found space well planetary mission works nasa published technical every space probe mission launched good university found simply mission read works first study reading space national moon jupiter lunar orbiter missions missions venus mars mars missions jupiter american japanese probe missions found sky telescope astronomy science scientific american time various major general information certain missions also show else going earth time space missions probably know just far space might also planetary society space groups world planetary exploration planetary report space probe missions planetary society california good studies area space exploration find planetary missions areas field human society many yet next faq planetary
